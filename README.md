scoop-extras
============

"Extras" bucket for Scoop.

This is for programs that don't strictly fit the mold of Scoop programs for at least one of the following reasons...

* it's a GUI program, or primarily GUI
* it's not designed for developers/programmers
* it's not well-known enough or widely used yet

... but they're still good to have because they're kinda cool or fun in some way.
