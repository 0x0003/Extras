scoop-extras
============

"Extras" bucket for [Scoop](http://scoop.sh).

This is for apps that don't strictly fit the mold of Scoop apps for at least one of the following reasons...

* it's primarily a GUI program
* it's not designed for developers/programmers
* it's not well-known enough or widely used yet

... but they're still good to have because they're kinda cool or fun or useful in some way.
